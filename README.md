# How old is it 
Mini project that help you to get some info about a project that contains `git` versioning such as how old is it? 

You can easily use `git log --reverse` to get initial commit of the project. Here we gonna add some more features.

TODO:
1- How many commit are there?
2- How many people worked on the project?
3- Sort collaborators by commit or lines of code? (not good metric but it's for fun only)
